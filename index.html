<p>The course of my life <a href="cv.pdf">(C.V.)</a> currently brings me to a postdoctoral appointment in the <a href="http://daphnia.ecology.uga.edu/drakelab">Drake lab</a> at the <a href="http://www.uga.edu">University of Georgia's</a> <a href="http://www.ecology.uga.edu">Odum School of Ecology</a>. My appointment is funded by <a href="http://www.epimodels.org">MIDAS</a> as a part of <a href="http://daphnia.ecology.uga.edu/midas/">Project AERO</a>, which has the stated goal of developing new methods for forecasting emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases based on the theory of critical slowing down. Professors <a href="http://www.ecology.uga.edu/facultyMember.php?Drake-21/">Drake</a> and <a href="http://www.ecology.uga.edu/facultyMember.php?Park-296/">Park</a> are supervising me.</p>
<p>The main theme of my research has been the development of methods to identify and estimate parameters for models of disease contact and transmission. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755436513000546">My work</a> has shown that, by pooling information from many outbreaks, transmission rates can be much more accurately estimated and associated with predictive variables. I have also developed <a href="http://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/21667/ODEA-DISSERTATION-2013.pdf?sequence=1">a method</a> to estimate the rates at which HIV-risk relationships form and break from a complex survey data set. <a href="http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ipid/2011/238743/abs/">My work</a> has also demonstrated how contact heteorgeneity may influence estimates of pathogen incidence based on molecular data, and a related project that develops methods for regression modeling of pathogen migration rates based on location-tagged sequences is <a href="https://github.com/e3bo/2015phylo">in progress</a>. In <a href="http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/09/26/017178">some work</a> on identification of models for the spread of an emerging porcine disease I learned about critical slowing down, and I'm looking forward to exploring the practical implications of such phenomena for surveillance.</p>
