<p>The main theme of my research has been the development of methods to identify and estimate parameters for models of disease contact and transmission. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755436513000546">My work</a> has shown that, by pooling information from many outbreaks, transmission rates can be much more accurately estimated and associated with predictive variables. I have also developed <a href="http://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/21667/ODEA-DISSERTATION-2013.pdf?sequence=1">a method</a> to estimate the rates at which HIV-risk relationships form and break from a complex survey data set. <a href="http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ipid/2011/238743/abs/">My work</a> has also demonstrated how contact heterogeneity may influence estimates of pathogen incidence based on molecular data, and a related project that develops methods for regression modeling of pathogen migration rates based on location-tagged sequences is <a href="https://github.com/e3bo/2015phylo">in progress</a>. In <a href="http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/09/26/017178">some work</a> on identification of models for the spread of an emerging porcine disease I learned about critical slowing down, and have since published 8 papers on the potential use of dynamical systems concepts in the forecasting of major shifts in the dynamics of infectious diseases. I have also become involved in several collaborative infectious disease forecasting projects, such as the <a href="https//covid19forecasthub.org">COVID-19 Forecast Hub</a>, and I continue to work in this area.</p>
