The course of my life [(C.V.)](cv.pdf) currently brings me to a
postdoctoral appointment in the [Drake
lab](http://daphnia.ecology.uga.edu/drakelab) at the [University of
Georgia's](http://www.uga.edu) [Odum School of
Ecology](http://www.ecology.uga.edu). My appointment is funded by
[MIDAS](http://www.epimodels.org) as a part of [Project
AERO](http://daphnia.ecology.uga.edu/midas/), which has the stated
goal of developing new methods for forecasting emergence and
re-emergence of infectious diseases based on the theory of critical
slowing down. Professors
[Drake](http://www.ecology.uga.edu/facultyMember.php?Drake-21/) and
[Park](http://www.ecology.uga.edu/facultyMember.php?Park-296/) are
supervising me.

The main theme of my research has been the development of methods to
identify and estimate parameters for models of disease contact and
transmission. [My
work](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755436513000546)
has shown that, by pooling information from many outbreaks,
transmission rates can be much more accurately estimated and
associated with predictive variables. I have also developed [a
method](http://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/21667/ODEA-DISSERTATION-2013.pdf?sequence=1)
to estimate the rates at which HIV-risk relationships form and break
from a complex survey data set. [My
work](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ipid/2011/238743/abs/) has also
demonstrated how contact heteorgeneity may influence estimates of
pathogen incidence based on molecular data, and a related project that
develops methods for regression modeling of pathogen migration rates
based on location-tagged sequences is [in
progress](https://github.com/e3bo/2015phylo). In [some
work](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/09/26/017178)
on identification of models for the spread of an emerging porcine
disease I learned about critical slowing down, and I'm looking forward
to exploring the practical implications of such phenomena for
surveillance.
