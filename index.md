The main theme of my research has been the development of methods to
identify and estimate parameters for models of disease contact and
transmission. [My
work](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755436513000546)
has shown that, by pooling information from many outbreaks,
transmission rates can be much more accurately estimated and
associated with predictive variables. I have also developed [a
method](http://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/21667/ODEA-DISSERTATION-2013.pdf?sequence=1)
to estimate the rates at which HIV-risk relationships form and break
from a complex survey data set. [My
work](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ipid/2011/238743/abs/) has also
demonstrated how contact heterogeneity may influence estimates of
pathogen incidence based on molecular data, and a related project that
develops methods for regression modeling of pathogen migration rates
based on location-tagged sequences is [in
progress](https://github.com/e3bo/2015phylo). In [some
work](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/09/26/017178) on
identification of models for the spread of an emerging porcine disease
I learned about critical slowing down, and have since contributed to
many [publications](http://daphnia.ecology.uga.edu/midas/?page_id=12)
on the potential use of dynamical systems concepts in the forecasting
of major shifts in the dynamics of infectious diseases. I have also
become involved in several collaborative infectious disease
forecasting projects, such as the [COVID-19 Forecast
Hub](https://covid19forecasthub.org), and I continue to work in this
area.
